## How To Use This Document

On the off chance that anyone besides myself stumbles upon The Slayer's Concord, welcome! Feel free to poke around use of the beasts within these pages if you like. One of the great benefits to using Git-book is the ability to open up change requests. They'll let you recommend changes, start conversations, and \(if you'd like\) allow you to contribute articles of your own.
